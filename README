============
time-compile
============

To build, use either Maven or Bazel.

Maven build
===========

    mvn package

The Maven build currently lacks the following:
* generate an executable jar
* pack dependencies into the jar (jopts)
* create an executable script for easier running

Bazel build
===========

    $ bazel build //:time-compile_deploy.jar
    $ ./bazel-bin/time-compile -h
    time-compile [OPTION...] TIMEFILE
     Options:
       -h, --help                       Show this help screen.
       -m, --maps=MAPFILE[,MAPFILE...]  Apply transformations to the tags.

To do
=====

* Move the tests away from the output jar.
